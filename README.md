Here’s how it works in simple terms:

You can easily find and watch your video lectures and read their PDF notes in one place.

To stay focused and avoid distractions, you save your downloaded study materials on your device in a clear folder structure.

Each subject (Physics, Chemistry, Math) has its own folder.

Inside each subject folder, there are chapters, and each chapter contains both the video lectures (.mp4) and notes (.pdf).

🏗️ Step 1: Create Main Folder
Create a main folder named PRAYAS where all your study materials will be organized.
![CREATE AN FOLDER NAMED PRAYAS](https://github.com/luvkushmina/project-images/blob/65f14ddd6f815333d4b3686fc04f38721881bfc1/Prayas%20folder/Screenshot%20from%202025-10-24%2012-55-23.png)

📘 Step 2: Create Subject Folders
Inside the PRAYAS folder, create separate subject folders such as Physics, Chemistry, and Maths to keep the materials well-sorted.

📂 Step 3: Create Chapter Folders
Within each subject folder, create folders for individual chapters.
This helps keep your lectures and notes for each topic isolated and easy to access.

🎥 Step 4: Add Lecture Videos & Notes
Inside each chapter folder, upload both:

Your video lectures (.mp4)

The corresponding PDF notes (.pdf)

Make sure that each PDF file has the same name as its video file for easy identification.
